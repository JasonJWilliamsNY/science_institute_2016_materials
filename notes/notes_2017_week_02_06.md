## The Ethics of DNA

#### Week of February 6th, 2017

In this class, we will introduce DNA Barcoding as the focus of this semester's work

**Pre-Lecture Concepts:**

Find definitions for the following terms. Please attempt to state the definitions in your own words:

1. DNA fingerprinting
2. DNA barcoding
3. Protein-coding DNA
4. Non-protein-coding DNA
5. PCR
6. DNA sequencing
7. Bioinformatics (Data Cleaning, BLAST, Multiple Alignment, Phylogenetic Trees)

**Lecture:**

This lecture will be based on the following presentation [Intro to DNA Barcoding](../presentations/barcoding_intro.pptx)

**Resource Links**
Additional resources you may wish to consider. 

- [Laboratory Manual](http://www.dnabarcoding101.org/files/using-dna-barcodes.pdf)
- [DNA Barcoding Resources Page](http://www.dnabarcoding101.org/resources/) - see the Animations and References Tab. 

**Homework:**

1. Bring in a sample of the following for next week's DNA extraction experiment
    - A sample of some food product you wish to identify
    - A sample of a plant (a single leaf) you wish to identify
Samples should be collected in a plastic tube. If the sample is wet (i.e. a fresh leaf, a moist food) you may place the sample in the class fridge/freezer. 
2. Take a brief look through the laboratory manual (linked above).
