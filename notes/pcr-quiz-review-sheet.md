## PCR Quiz Review Sheet

**Quiz Format**
Quiz will be short answer. You will be responsible for answering your choice of 5 out of 7 provided questions.  Some basic math may be required and calculators (but not cell phones) are permissible. Complete sentences are not absolutely necessary, but being clear and understandable will get the most credit. Each answer is worth 20 points (out of 100). There will also be a bonus topic.

**What to Study**
- Know the several classifications of mutation and be able to identify them (e.g. Insertion, Deletion, Transition, Transversion). 
- Know the components of the PCR reaction and their functions (e.g. Template DNA, primers, etc.). 
- Know the steps of the PCR process and details on what is happening at each step (e.g. Denature, Anneal, etc.)
- Be able to calculate the probability of a primer match to an arbitrary region of the genome. 
- Know the basic characteristics of mitochondrial DNA and differences between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA**Note**
All of these items were covered (to varying levels) in class. You can use your notes, each other, and any other books or online resources. Spending about 30 minutes to consolidate notes and research into a study sheet (you can actually do this in your class notebook) should be sufficient preparation for the quiz. There will be time in class on Monday for any questions, or to resolve anything that is unclear.
