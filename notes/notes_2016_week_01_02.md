## What is CRISPR

#### Week of January 2nd, 2017

In this last class of the fall semester, we will look forward to a technology that will revolutionize molecular biology and the world. 

**SEMESTER-END EXAM NOTES**

Semester final assignment will be a long quiz/short test (quest) take-home exam. The exam will be open-book. You may use all notes from this semester, but are not permitted to use any online resources outside of links contained in the notes. I anticipate the exam will consist of 7 mandatory questions (out of a possible 10). The exam will be emailed out on **Monday, January 9th, 2017** and will be due by 5:00PM **Wednesday, January 18th, 2017.** The exam will be shared with you as a Google doc and more instructions will follow. Once you start the exam, you will have 2 hours to complete the exam; edits after 5:00PM on the 18th will not be gradable.

**Exam Topics:**

- Lab safety 
- Basic lab math (Calculate number of moles, molarity, dilution)
- Philosophy of science short-essay question on fallacies
- Ethics short-essay question
- PCR (including purpose of all steps and components of the reaction, and understanding of how/PCR is used)
- Mutation types
- DNA extraction (including the lab protocol and the purpose of each step)
- Sanger DNA sequencing (including purpose of all steps and components of the reaction)
- Mitochondrial DNA lab (be able to explain the objectives of this lab)
- DNA Subway (understand what a file format is, and what a BLAST search does)


**Concepts and Vocabulary:**

1. Genetic engineering
2. GMO
3. Flavr Savr tomato
4. CRISPR-Cas9
5. GINA (Genetics Information Nondiscrimination Act)
6. Eugenics

**Lecture:**

CIRSPR is a biological technology that allows us to edit DNA (Much as we can do in class later with [Restriction Enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme)). If previously, our ability to edit DNA could be compared to writing on clay tablets, CRISPR is like using software word processing. This technology will probably revolutionize the world, and will certainly impact your life - for the better? With what scientific, moral, and ethical implications?
