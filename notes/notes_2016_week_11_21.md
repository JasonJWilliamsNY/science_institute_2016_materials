## Manipulating DNA in the lab

#### Week of November 21st, 2016


In this lab, we will go about the process of preparing DNA (our own) for sequencing. 

**Vocabulary and concepts**

* Extracting (and purifying) DNA
* Buccal cheek cells
* Mitochondrial DNA
* PCR
* (Sanger) DNA sequencing
* Gene
* Mutation

### Introduction

DNA is (a so-called "secret of life") is very much at the center of modern biology. In this lab, we will obtain DNA Samples using a saline mouth-rinse, and prepare DNA from the collected cells. Next, we will amplify sections of mitochondrial DNA using PCR. The copied DNA will then be sent for sequencing, and we will analyze the results in class. 

**Lab Protocols**

We will be following the following protocol (with some modifications):

- [MT Lab protocol](http://www.geneticorigins.org/mito/mitoframeset.htm)
- DNA Primer information: 
    - Forward primer: 	<br>5'-TTAACTCCACCATTAGCACC-3'
    - Reverse primer: <br> 5'-GAGGATGGTGGTCAAGGGAC-3'
