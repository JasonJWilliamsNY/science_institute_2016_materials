## The tools of Molecular Biology 

[Molecular Biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology) is the understanding of biology and life at the level of molecules. Working with small and unseen entities is everyday task of the molecular biologist. While a botanist or a zoologist is making note of the macroscopic, a molecular biologist is working at the microscopic scale and beyond (see: [Universcale](http://www.nikon.com/about/feelnikon/universcale/). The chief molecule DNA, and the other molecules of life (other nucleic acids like RNA, Proteins, etc.) are for the most part invisible to the unaided eye. Our interaction with molecular biology is through the tools of chemistry and physics, and hopefully with an understanding that what we cannot see is often more important than what we can see. This week's laboratory demo will introduce some key concepts and also some particle introduction. 

The micropipette (see [supplemental materials](./pdfs/Micropipettor.pdf) is the ubiquitous tool of the laboratory. We will use this tool to move liquids during the DNA extraction Demo. 



## DNA Extraction Demo
In this demo, we will observe the precipitation of DNA from E.coli bacterial cells. The notes for this lab are sparse, but there are some important thinking questions that help us build principles and concepts for performing any of the labs we will attempt this year. 

**Protocol**
1. Collect E.coli bacteria from petri dishes and suspend in 5ml of LB media (alternatively, use a pre-made suspension). 
2. Add 3ml of soap solution; mix thoroughly
3. Heat at 65C for 15 minutes
4. Add 3ml ethanol (add slowly without mixing to create a distinct layer)
5. Use a loop to extract the precipitated nucleic acids.
