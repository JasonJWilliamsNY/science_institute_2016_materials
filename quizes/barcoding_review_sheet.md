    - What are the 4 "How Barcoding Works" steps? (be able to say a little about each one)
    - What are the 3 factors that are involved in choosing a DNA barcoding region of DNA? (know the names and be able to give a simple explanation for each one)
    - What gene(s) is used for barcoding in animals, plants?

- From the DNA extraction protocol done in class [link - pg. 2](https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/protcards/wizard-genomic-dna-purification-kit-quick-protocol.pdf)
    - Be able to give a brief explanation of what DNA extraction is

### Additional Resources

- Barcoding animation [link](https://www.dnalc.org/resources/animations/dna-barcoding.html) ( **Note:** we not not exactly follow all the protocols used in this animation). 


Note All of these items were covered (to varying levels) in class. You can use your notes, each other, and any other books or online resources. Spending about 30 minutes to consolidate notes and research into a study sheet (you can actually do this in your class notebook) should be sufficient preparation for the quiz. There will be time in class on Monday for any questions, or to resolve anything that is unclear.
